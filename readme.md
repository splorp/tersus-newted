# Tersus: Newted

An achingly simple child theme for [Tersus](https://github.com/splorp/tersus/).


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

By removing the majority of the presentational markup and other cruft from the [Tersus](https://github.com/splorp/tersus/) parent theme, we’ve opened the door for child themes to pick up the aesthetic slack. There are currently three child themes being developed for Tersus.

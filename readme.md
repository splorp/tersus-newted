# Newted for Tersus

An achingly simple child theme for [Tersus](https://tersustheme.com/).


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

By removing the majority of the presentational markup and other cruft from the [Tersus](http://tersustheme.com/) parent theme, we’ve opened the door for child themes to pick up the aesthetic slack. There are currently three child themes being developed for Tersus.
